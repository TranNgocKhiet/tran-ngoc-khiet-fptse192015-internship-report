For early-career cloud professionals, gaining hands-on experience with real customer engagements can be challenging. Even when shadowing opportunities exist, the fast-paced nature of these interactions rarely allows time to pause, reflect, and truly understand complex concepts.

[AWS SimuLearn](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-simulearn/) addresses this gap by combining generative AI-driven customer simulations with practical technical training. Powered by [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), AWS SimuLearn provides an immersive, risk-free environment where you can develop both technical and soft skills through interactive customer conversations, solution concept videos, hands-on labs, and practical exercises—all at your own pace.

In this post, we’ll follow three early-career AWS Solutions Architects who used these role-based learning plans and simulations to enhance their cloud expertise and customer-facing readiness. Their experiences demonstrate how structured practice in a controlled environment can accelerate professional development.

## Hetvi’s story: Role-based learning focused on generative AI

As a new Solutions Architect, I faced a common challenge: how to effectively communicate complex technical solutions to business leaders. While I was confident in my technical knowledge, translating cloud concepts into business value proved to be a different skill altogether.

AWS SimuLearn transformed my approach to customer conversations. Through interactive simulations, I practiced engaging with virtual customers who needed generative AI solutions for their business challenges.

One memorable scenario involved helping a retail client understand how AI could enhance their customer experience through personalized shopping recommendations. I was provided with immediate feedback on both my technical recommendations and communication style. I learned to replace technical jargon with business outcomes, focusing on ROI and operational improvements rather than architectural specifications.

What made the experience invaluable was the ability to retry conversations and experiment with different approaches. Each iteration helped me refine my message and build confidence in handling complex customer interactions.

Today, I can confidently bridge the gap between technical solutions and business value, a skill that’s proven essential in my role as a Solutions Architect. For anyone looking to enhance their customer communication skills in technical roles, AWS SimuLearn offers a risk-free environment to practice and grow.

## Karishma’s story: Building technical depth

As a Solutions Architect, I’ve found that deep technical expertise is essential for designing effective customer solutions. To expand my technical depth, I’ve combined individual training topics in AWS SimuLearn to create a structured learning experience tailored to real-world technical challenges.

I started with security at the edge, progressing through modules on network security, encryption, identity and access management, and finally serverless technologies like [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), and [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/). Each module included simulated customer interactions where I practiced gathering requirements and proposing solutions, followed by hands-on labs to solidify my understanding.

By combining [training modules](https://skillbuilder.aws/search?searchText=%22AWS+SimuLearn%22&page=1&isValidSearchText=true), I was able to simulate customer-specific workflows, ensuring a deeper grasp of their challenges. This personalized approach didn’t just prepare me for customer presentations, it gave me a framework to continuously refine my technical depth. With AWS SimuLearn, I can now rapidly upskill in unfamiliar areas and confidently architect solutions that align with business objectives, making me a more effective Solutions Architect.

## Kattie’s story: Industry-based learning

My background is in designing and developing software tools for Health Care and Life Sciences (HCLS) research teams. While I’m familiar with several programming languages, I had limited cloud knowledge at the level of an [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) and wanted to expand my knowledge about how AWS can be utilized in the HCLS industry. Additionally, I wanted to gain in-depth knowledge about various AWS services, use cases, and integration with third-party software.

The [AWS SimuLearn: Healthcare Learning Plan](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/public/learning_plan/view/2239/aws-simulearn-Healthcare) provided a wide range of business problems that gave me the opportunity to experiment with various AWS services to find technical solutions for the business problems. For example, I experimented with services relevant to HIPAA compliance with [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) and [AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/) and AI with [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), as well as batch processing, analytics, database and storage, dashboards with real-time data processing, IoT, and more.

Each learning plan can be started using the Open Dialogue mode or the Scripted mode. Initially, I chose the Scripted mode because it was less challenging, but once I observed a few different simulated conversations, I felt comfortable using the Open Dialogue mode. Open Dialogue mode offers an opportunity to hone your soft skills through an interactive, real-time customer conversation.

Along the way, AWS SimuLearn provides helpful hints to guide the conversation, as well as an incomplete architecture diagram for you to expand upon during the dialogue with the customer. You also get asked questions regarding different services to further enhance the learning experience.

## Get started with AWS SimuLearn

Through simulated customer conversations and hands-on learning, AWS SimuLearn helped these three early-career professionals on their learning journeys. They received real-time feedback to improve their soft and technical skills while gaining experience in a live console environment.

With 200+ trainings, including learning options available by cloud role or industry, AWS SimuLearn offers you a personalized learning experience. Game-based training with simulations empowers early-career professionals to build both technical expertise and customer engagement skills in a risk-free environment.
