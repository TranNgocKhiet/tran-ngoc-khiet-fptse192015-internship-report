# Summary Report: “AI-Driven Development Life Cycle: Reimagining Software Engineering”

### Event Objectives

- Explores AI-Driven Development using Amazon Q Developer
- Explores Spec-Driven Development using Kiro

### Speakers

- **Toan Huynh** – SA
- **My Nguyen** – ISV Account Director

### Key Highlights

#### The Role of AI in IT

- **2023**: AI acted as an assistant, helping developers minimize workload, recommend code, and check errors
- **2024**: AI became embedded in IDEs, enabling system design and automated workflows
- **2025**: Software engineers with strong AI skills can develop products in minimal time

#### Developing Products with AI While Keeping Humans at the Center

- Developers can use AI to generate code but they still must validate its correctness and effectiveness
- The owner of AI-generated code is the developer, since they are responsible for validating it before implementation
- Coding with AI usually leads to two paths:
  * **AI-Assistant**: Developers see AI as a co-worker who suggests code and solutions
  * **AI-Manager**: AI takes full responsibility for designing systems, generating and implementing code, and maintaining the product
  
#### AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)

- AI acts as an assistant that helps to develop the requirements and specifications
- AI supports developers by writing code in small units step-by-step, waiting for validation before moving on to the next task
- It requires developers to minimize the scope and provide a specified prompt for AI  
- Mob programming is recommended for this methodology since it reduces product development time

#### Spec-Driven Development Lifecycle with Kiro

- Kiro is an IDE that supports developers by taking specifications and developing step-by-step tasks to implement them into code
- Kiro provides a log of all the actions and prompts, allowing developers to track progress
- Kiro is suitable for projects that need to have accurate specifications before starting to write code
 
### Key Takeaways

#### Developer Mindset

- **Human-centric**: AI can design systems and write code, but developers remain responsible for validating the results
- **Ready for changes**: With powerful AI tools like Amazon Q Developer and Kiro emerging, developers should continuously prepare for new technologies

#### Pros and Cons

- Using Ai-Driven or Spec-Driven Development Lifecycle depends on the scope and purpose of the project
- Each method has pros and cons that affect the development team as well as the product
- **Pros**
  * **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle** is good for projects that need the speed, reusability, cost efficiency, and scalability
  * **Spec-Driven Development Lifecycle** is good for projects that need narrative quality, consistency, and predictability
- **Cons**
  * **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle** may result in inconsistent quality, ethical/IP concerns, or maintenance challenges
  * **Spec-Driven Development Lifecycle** may result in slower production cycles, higher costs, or limited content

### Applying to Work

- **Apply AI-DLC or SDD** to current projects
- **Learn new technologies** like Amazon Q Developer or Kiro

### Event Experience

Attending the **“AI-Driven Development Life Cycle: Reimagining Software Engineering”** workshop was extremely valuable. I had the opportunity to learn new methodologies and connect with IT professionals. Key experiences included:

#### Learning from highly skilled speakers
- Learning from experts how they handle errors in coding and product development
- Experiencing real-world use cases of the methodologies

#### Leveraging modern tools
- Explored **Amazon Q Developer**, an AI tool that supports AI-DLC
- Observed a demonstration of how Kiro is used in the Spec-Driven Development Lifecycle

> Overall, the event not only provided technical knowledge but also introduced to new tools that can support development lifecycle
