### Key Highlights

#### Prompting Techniques

- Effective prompting techniques for better and accurate result

#### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

- AI with embedded data source to response with more accurate, real-time and included internal data result
  
#### Embedding

- Numerical representation of text (vectors) that captures semantics and relationships betwwen words
- Embedding models capture features and nuances of the text
- Rich embedding models can be used to compare text similarity
- Multilingual Text Embeddings can identify mearing in different languages
