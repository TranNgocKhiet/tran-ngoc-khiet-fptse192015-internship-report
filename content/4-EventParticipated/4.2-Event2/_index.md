# Summary Report: "AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1: AI/ML/GenAI on AWS"

### Event Objectives

- Introduce to Foundation Model
- ​Prompting techniques guide
- Explore Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock
- ​Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Architecture & Knowledge Base integration

### Speakers

- Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi 
- Lam Truong Kiet
- Dinh Le Hoang Anh

### Key Highlights

#### Prompting Techniques

- Effective prompting techniques for better and accurate result

#### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

- AI with embedded data source to response with more accurate, real-time and included internal data result
  
#### Embedding

- Numerical representation of text (vectors) that captures semantics and relationships betwwen words
- Embedding models capture features and nuances of the text
- Rich embedding models can be used to compare text similarity
- Multilingual Text Embeddings can identify mearing in different languages

#### Some AWS AI Service

- Amazon Rekognition
- Amazon Translate
- Amazon Textract
- Amazon Transcribe
- Amazon Polly
- Amazon Comprehend
- Amazon Kendra

- Aamzon Personalize

### Key Takeaways

#### Prompting Techniques - Chain of thought

- Providing AI with an example case
- Explain for AI step-by-step to handle your problem

#### RAG use cases

- Reducing hallucinations and connecting with recent knowledge including enterprise data
- Enchance chatbox capabilities by integrating with real-time data
- Searching base on user previous search history and persona
- Retrieving and summarizing transactional data from data 

#### Amazon Titan Embedding

- Translate text inputs (words, phrases) into numerical representations (embeddings)
- Comparing embeddings produces more relevant and contextual responses than word matching
- Max Tokens: 8000
- Output Vectors: 256,512,1024
- Language: Multilingual (100+ languages in preview)

### Applying to Work
